CI/CD - Jenkins & Docker 
* Pipeline-as-code
create a CI/CD pipeline that automates the pull of an API Builder project code from GitHub, 
create the Docker image, push the image to Docker Hub, 
and run it as a Docker container in a deployment server.

You need to have jenkins up and running.
With this you will test:
- Pipeline script.(Declare the Jenkinsfile script in the project Pipeline)
- Pipeline SCM. (Use the jenkinsfile dinamically from github)
